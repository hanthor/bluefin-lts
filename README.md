Currently there are 4 forks:
- [![Build](https://github.com/hanthor/tunaOS/actions/workflows/build-regular.yml/badge.svg?branch=a10s)](https://github.com/hanthor/tunaOS/actions/workflows/build-regular.yml) üê† **[Yellowfin](https://github.com/hanthor/tunaOS/tree/a10s)** `a10s` - based on [AlmaLinux Kitten 10](https://wiki.almalinux.org/development/almalinux-os-kitten-10.html#container-images)
  - This is the closest to upstream Bluefin LTS but with AlmaLinux Kitten 10 which has [some differences](https://wiki.almalinux.org/development/almalinux-os-kitten-10.html#how-is-almalinux-os-kitten-different-from-centos-stream) like:
    - x86_64/v2 support
    - SPICE support for qemu/livirt
    - Secureboot support (though upstream CentOS will have this again [soon](https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues/454))

I'm currently dailying `bluefin-dx:a10s` and plan on using `bluefin:a10-server` as a replacemnt to my Proxmox server. Let me know if you are using/liking any of these images. I'm currently assuming I'm the only one using the right now.
